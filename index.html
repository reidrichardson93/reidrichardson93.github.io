					<h2>ChangeBot</h2>
					<p>ChangeBot is designed to handle the back end of a self-checkout kiosk.</p>
					<p>The program kept track of the till, the items purchased, the amount due, the amount paid, and the change due.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>CheckerBot</h2>
					<p>CheckerBot is a console checkers program that was entirely created from the back end.</p>
					<p>The program knew the rules of checkers and would play until either all red pieces or all black pieces were jumped.</p>
					<p>CheckerBot is a two player game and does not support AI play.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Windows Forms</h2>
					<p>Most recently I have been working with windows forms creating a GUI to go along with my back-end code.</p>
					<p>My most recent forms project counts the ranked words in any file or text then displays the number and percentage of ranked words.</p>
